hI!

thank you for downloading my music. I hope you'll like it and find great use for it :)

Did you know that my music is also on spotify, and that listening to my music there is a phenomenal way to
support me?

You can find my artist page here https://open.spotify.com/artist/7tuhz1Gz9N1ImIc8eJsqiY

Also, I have made a playlist with my music and other great 8-bit/chiptune/bitpop musicans. I add new stuff to it
quite often, so it's definitely worth checking out.

If you don't have Spotify, that's fine! :) I'm available on most streaming services. For a complete list of services,
